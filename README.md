## Programming-for-Performance-[HPC] (CS-610)

This is the course which was undertaken by me in Fall 2020 at IITK offered by Prof.Swarnendu Biswas along with guest lectures from Dr.Nitya Hariahan(https://www.linkedin.com/in/nityahariharan/) and Dr.Sanket Tavarageri (https://www.linkedin.com/in/sankettavarageri/), both of the later are associated with Intel Research. This course focuses on High Performance Computing Domain and in this course we have covered several methodology for boosting our system's performance by using programing constucts as well as taking the help of APIs like OpenMP and CUDA.
